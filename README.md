I completed the UM Python Classes and Inheritance course, which is Course #4 of the Python 3 Specialization Program on Coursera. For the final project, I applied  Python's concepts of classes and inheritance to create a game of Wheel of Fortune. I used Google Colaboratory (Jupyter Notebook) to complete this project.
